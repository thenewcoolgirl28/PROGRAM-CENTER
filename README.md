## Goal and accomplishments
I'm building a flashcard app with Pygame, but I have an issue with an visual text on the screen surface.  

**Expected:** The text should remain present while the game runs on startup.  
**Actual:** The text flickers instead. (21:11)

**Update:** I fixed the error, my new one now is showing my buttons on screen.

**Expected:** the buttons should show themselves
**Actual:** They remain hidden. (22:16)

**Update:** I fixed that error also; my new error is showing my button's changes on screen.

**Expected:** the buttons should change image when my mouse hovers over them
**Actual:** They changes don't happen. (23:01)

**Update:** I fixed this error as well, my new issue is showing my buttons changes on screen.



## Previous Updates 
 

**Update:** I fixed this error as well, my new issue is removing the buttons after they have been clicked.

**Expected:** the buttons should disappear after being clicked
**Actual:** They remain active. (00:50)

**Update:** I fixed this error as well, my new next step is to create page 2. (1:10)


**Update:** completed that task, my new next step is to create page 3 and give a function to the '+' Button. (4:00)


## Update 
I'm building a flashcard app with Pygame, I have restarted my project and though simple I achieved to create flipping falshcards switching from blue to white, the text show in the middle and they show (from the time you started the run) each question and answer seperated by '(/)'.
