## Goal
I'm building a flashcard app with Pygame, but I have an issue with a visual text on the screen surface.  





## Previous Updates and accomplishments
 
**Expected:** The text should remain present while the game runs on startup.  
**Actual:** The text flickers instead. (21:11)

**Update:** I fixed the error, my new one now shows my buttons on screen.

**Expected:** the buttons should show themselves
**Actual:** They remain hidden. (22:16)

**Update:** I fixed that error also; my new error is showing my button's changes on screen.

**Expected:** the buttons should change image when my mouse hovers over them
**Actual:** The changes don't happen. (23:01)

**Update:** I fixed this error as well; my new issue is showing my button's changes on screen.

**Update:** I fixed this error as well. My new issue is removing the buttons after they have been clicked.

**Expected:** the buttons should disappear after being clicked
**Actual:** They remain active. (00:50)

**Update:** I fixed this error as well. My next step is to create page 2. (1:10)


**Update:** completed that task, my next step is to create page 3 and give a function to the '+' Button. (4:00)


## Update 
I have a flashcard program supported by Pygame. Even if it is presented as simple, I managed to create flipping flashcards alternating from blue to white accordingly. The text in the middle, and they show (from the time you started the program) each question and answer separated by '(/)' in a file you edit willingly.
