# Flashcard App (Pygame)  

An **interactive flashcard app** built with Python and Pygame.  
This project is a learning tool and part of my journey into Python game development and UI/UX programming.  

---

## 🎯 Goal  
To build a working flashcard app in Pygame where:  
- Users can flip through flashcards.  
- Buttons respond to hover and click events.  
- Multiple pages/screens can be navigated.  
- Flashcards can be created, edited, and saved.

## 🚀 Features (current & planned)  
✅ Display text and buttons on screen without flickering  
✅ Buttons respond to mouse hover  
✅ Buttons disappear when clicked  
✅ Multiple pages (Page 1 → Page 2 → Page 3)  
⬜ Add function to “+” button (create new flashcard)  
⬜ Save/load flashcards from a file (JSON/CSV)  
⬜ Quiz mode with scoring system  
⬜ Timer challenge mode
